## Ceramic http api
The Ceramic daemon creates an http endpoint from which various operations can be performed.

### `/api/v0/create` - `POST`

#### Post data
Only `content` is required.

```js
{
  content: <content-json>,
  doctype: <string>, // defaults to "tile"
  owners: <owners-string-array> // defaults to current user
}
```

### `/api/v0/show/<document-id>` - `GET`
Returns the content of the given document.

##### Optional query parameters:
* `?version=<CID>` - the version of the document to show (CID of the anchor record)
