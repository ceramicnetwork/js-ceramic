**js-ceramic** is a monorepo containing the TypeScript implementation of the Ceramic protocol. If you are unfamiliar with Ceramic, see the [website](https://ceramic.network) or [overview](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic) for more information.

> **Project status**: **`Clay` testnet is now live. ðŸš€** <br/>
> Clay is a decentralized public network ready for experimental application development and testing. It anchors documents on the Ethereum Ropsten and Rinkeby testnets. It is the last major milestone before `Fire` mainnet, which is under development and will launch in late Q1 2021. Documents published on Clay will *not* be portable to Fire.

## Clients

`js-ceramic` provides three JavaScript clients that offer different ways to interact with the Ceramic network.

| Client | Package | Description | Current Version |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Core | @ceramicnetwork/core | Full JavaScript protocol implementation | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ceramicnetwork/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/core) |
| CLI | @ceramicnetwork/cli | CLI and HTTP daemon | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ceramicnetwork/cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/cli) |
| HTTP | @ceramicnetwork/http-client | HTTP client that can interact with a remote Ceramic daemon | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ceramicnetwork/http-client)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/http-client) |

> For performance reasons it is recommended that you use the HTTP client if you are building an application.
