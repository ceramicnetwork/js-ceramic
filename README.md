**js-ceramic** is a monorepo containing the TypeScript implementation of the Ceramic protocol. If you are unfamiliar with Ceramic, see the [website](https://ceramic.network) or [overview](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/welcome/) for more information.

> **Project status**: **Access  the Ceramic mainnet. ðŸš€** <br/>
> With the launch of [ComposeDB Beta](https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-is-live-on-ceramic-mainnet/), it is now much easier to access Ceramic mainnet for building applications.
> Developers can now onboard their node to Ceramic mainnet in under 5 minutes without needing to contact any community members. Check out [this guide](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/access-mainnet)
> to learn more.


## Clients

`js-ceramic` provides three JavaScript clients that offer different ways to interact with the Ceramic network.

| Client | Package                     | Description                                                | Current Version                                                                                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core   | @ceramicnetwork/core        | Full JavaScript protocol implementation                    | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ceramicnetwork/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/core)               |
| CLI    | @ceramicnetwork/cli         | CLI and HTTP daemon                                        | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ceramicnetwork/cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/cli)                 |
| HTTP   | @ceramicnetwork/http-client | HTTP client that can interact with a remote Ceramic daemon | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ceramicnetwork/http-client)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/http-client) |

> For performance reasons it is recommended that you use the HTTP client if you are building an application.
