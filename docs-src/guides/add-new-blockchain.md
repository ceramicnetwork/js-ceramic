# Add support for new blockchain

This document contains a guide on how to add support for a new blockchain to the [`caip10-link`](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md) doctype, as well as to use for authentication.

## Overview: Ceramic and blockchain accounts

Ceramic interacts with blockchain accounts in two ways:
- authentication
- linking

**Authentication.** 3ID Connect (using `3id-did-provider`) creates `3id` (Ceramic flavour of DID) private keys
based on an externally-provided entropy. It could be provided by a blockchain account by merely
signing a well-known message. From a user's standpoint,
it is authentication _into_ Ceramic through her blockchain account, be it on Ethereum, Filecoin,
EOS, Cosmos or something else. Same signature (=same entropy) generates same Ceramic DID.

**Linking.** In addition to generating a DID a user could also _link_ additional blockchain accounts to a Ceramic DID.
It establishes a relation `blockchain account â†’ DID` that allows one to discover DID along with social profile
based on just a blockchain account. Additionally, a link serves as a proof-of-ownership by DID over the blockchain account.
This has proven to be useful for dApp personalization: one sees familiar names instead of `0xgibberish`.

Below one additional process is mentioned: validation. It checks if _proof-of-ownership_ in the link is formally correct,
i.e., a well-known payload is really signed by the account that is declared in the link.

## Adding a new blockchain

To add a new blockchain to Ceramic one has to implement both linking and validation. 

### Linking

We use [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md) to represent accounts in a blockchain agnostic way.
If the blockchain you want to add isn't already part of the CAIP standards you should make sure to add it there.

To add a new blockchain, one has to implement a new class implementing [AuthProvider](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/blob/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-linking/src/auth-provider.ts), put it
into the [`@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking`](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-linking) package and export it.
See existing auth providers for inspiration.

The auth provider is expected to be mainly called in a web browser as part of [3id-connect](https://github.com/3box/3id-connect) flow.
The auth provider sits between 3id-connect (or 3ID DID Provider) and your blockchain account provider. In case of Ethereum,
it might be MetaMask. The auth provider is responsible mainly for:
- authentication (`#authenticate`): provide entropy
- creating link (`#createLink`): create a LinkProof object which associates the specified AccountID with the DID

The auth provider is expected to know which blockchain account it currently serves. It reports it via `#accountId`.
To reuse the same internal settings, e.g. a connection to a blockchain provider, but with a different account,
the auth provider should have a `#withAddress` method.

To sum it all up, to add a new blockchain for linking:
- add a new class implementing the `AuthProvider` interface to the `@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking` package.
- its `authenticate` method should ask the blockchain provider for an authentication signature and return 32 bytes
  in form of `0x`-prefixed hex string.
- its `createLink` method should ask the blockchain provider for a linking signature and return a `LinkProof` data structure.
- its `accountId` method should return currently used account in the CAIP-10 format.
- its `withAccount` method should return a new instance of the auth provider that serves a new account.

### Validation

Validation is the counterpart of [#linking] that checks if the signature contained in a `LinkProof` corresponds to the declared account.

To add a new blockchain:
- add a new file named after your blockchain to `@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-validation` package
- this file should expose an implementation of the `BlockchainHandler` interface, having:
    - [CAIP-2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md) `namespace` for your blockchain
    - a `validateLink` function that checks if the linking signature was created by the account declared in the `LinkProof` argument
- add the newly created `BlockchainHandler` to the `handlers` list in [index.ts](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/blob/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-validation/src/index.ts)

Make sure that `validateLink` can validate links created by `AuthProvider#createLink`.

## Supported blockchains

Below you can see a table which lists supported blockchains and their provider objects.

| Blockchain | CAIP-2 namespace | Supported providers             |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Ethereum   | [eip155](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-3.md)    | metamask-like ethereum provider |
| Filecoin   | [fil](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-23.md)              | [Filecoin Wallet Provider](https://github.com/openworklabs/filecoin-wallet-provider) |
| EOS        | [eosio](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-7.md)              | [@smontero/eosio-local-provider](https://github.com/sebastianmontero/eosio-local-provider#readme) |
